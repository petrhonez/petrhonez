I'm 21 and currently studying Control and Automation Engineering. 

I’m focused on developing devices for image and video production, combining hardware, code, and visual design.

This is just an expression of my ideas and projects.

## Interests

Camera technology and visual systems

Motion amplification

Microcontrollers and embedded systems

Image sensors, old solar cells, LCDs, and polarizing filters

Low-power display tech (e.g. e-ink)

Color usage in design

## Curiosities

How cameras interpret light and movement

Visual perception in machines

Reuse of analog tech in modern builds

## Vision

Build tools and devices that expand how we capture and process images

Apply automation and embedded tech to creative hardware

Work on camera-oriented products for research, media, or industrial use
