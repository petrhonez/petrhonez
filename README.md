> ## [![pc](anonw.png)](https://www.youtube.com/@petrhonezzz) `About me`

I'm 21 and currently studying Control and Automation Engineering. ![img](lght.png)

I'm using GitHub just as an expression of my ideas and projects, for fun and experience. ![ex3](operw.png)

I'm focused on developing devices for image and video production, combining hardware, code, and visual design. ![ex](bina.webp)
